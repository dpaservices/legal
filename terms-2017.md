DPA Services Ltd provides website design and related services throughout the UK, this page outlines our terms and conditions and will also provide you with a better idea of how we work enabling both DPA Services Ltd and its clients to fully understand where we stand.

Upon acceptance of a proposal and or agreement both parties enter into a contract.  You will give us everything we need to complete the project, as and when and in the format we need it. You will review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you will also be bound by dates we set together. You will also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out within the contract.

Us: We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we will do it all in a professional and timely manner.

###Design and Development

We create look-and-feel designs and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes where applicable. We may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (colour, texture and typography.) We call this a ‘design atmosphere’ these will be provided to you in image format for your approval.

You will have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We will share our work via Dropbox or our development area with you and have regular contact. If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the direction our work is taking, you’ll pay us in full for everything we’ve produced until that point and cancel the contract.

###Text content

We are not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you’d like us to write new content or input text for you, we can provide a separate estimate for this.

###Photographs

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you would like us to search for stock photographs on your behalf, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

###HTML, CSS and JavaScript

We deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.

###Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

###Changes and revisions

We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. We do not want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we will need to accomplish everything you have told us that you want to achieve, but we are happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, this won’t be a problem as we will provide a separate estimate for that. Any additions to the website or additinal functionality that is not in the initial agreement will be completed at the end of the initial contract.

###Legal stuff

We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you have advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of any contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from such contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

###Mutual Cooperation
We agree to use our best efforts to fulfill and exceed your expectation on the deliverables listed in the scope of work. You agree to aid us in doing so by making available the information as needed that we require and to work with us to expedite the work.

###Charges for Services Performed
Functionality or feature requests above and beyond those listed in our proposal may be considered out-of-scope and an amendment to the budget will be recommended.

###Dormant Projects
Projects that go dormant for longer than 30 days will incur a fee to resume work, this will be at the descretion of DPA Services Ltd.

###Copyrights

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When your final payment has cleared and the project is completed, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You will own the visual elements that we create for this project (the theme). We will give you access to source files and finished files. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we reserve the right to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

###Payments

We are sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the payment schedule.

DPA Services will invoice 50% of the initial fees at the point you accept the proposal by way of signature, this will act as a non refundable deposit. The remaining 50% will be billed monthly as the service hours are spent or upon completion of the development.

###Client Agreement To Pay
You agree to pay our initial invoice upon receipt which will act as a deposit for the project. Every invoice after that will have 15 day payment terms. In the event an invoice is not satisfied within 15 days DPA Services will apply an administration fee at its descretion in order to chase and satisfy the account balance at that point in time. DPA Services Ltd reserves the right to stop development and or stop web services until full payment has been made.

In the event that we incurr legal fees, costs and disbursements in an effort to collect our invoices, in addition to any administration fees, you agree to reimburse us for these expenses.

#####But where’s all the horrible small print?

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in England & Wales.
